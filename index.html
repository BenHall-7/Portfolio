          <h2>Conway's Game of Life</h2>
          <p>
            Devised by the late British mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">
            John Horton Conway</a>, the Game of Life is a simple 2D simulation of cells treated as organisms.
            These cells follow a simple set of mathematical rules meant to emulate basic rules of populations,
            determining whether they are considered "alive" or "dead". The rules are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If a living cell has 2 or 3 neighbors ('neighbors' includes diagonals), it remains living.
              Otherwise, it dies
            </li>
            <li>
              If a dead cell (or rather, empty cell) has 3 neighbors exactly, it becomes alive.
              Otherwise it remains dead.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In this way, a strategically placed set of cells may remain in existence forever, in a loop.
            Many configurations of cells die off completely; many explode first and can lead into either outcome.
            <br/>
            The Game of Life is only one such example of a broader topic of interest, known as
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">Cellular Automata.</a>
            Cellular Automata (CA for short) describes systems of these cells in grids (which may not necessarily
            be 2D) and how they behave under certain other rulesets. These are useful in some branches of science
            for examining behavior of real systems such as those studied under Biology or Chemistry.
            <br/>
            Another interesting property of the game is that it exhibits Turing Completeness, a quality of a system
            by which you can perform arbitrary calculations. This is made possible through cell patterns such as the
            Gosper Gun, which if set up correctly may emulate a NAND gate instruction, an essential logical operator
            seen in hardware necessary to run machine instructions. Note that we also give ourselves infinite time
            and grid space when discussing the game's Turing Completeness. This means also that it is possible to
            replicate the Game of Life <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP5-iIeKXE8">inside the Game of Life
            itself</a> with huge blocks of cells that work to calculate the results of their neighbor blocks.
          </p>
          <h2>Implementation</h2>
          <p>
            The implementation on this website was developed by myself, using Rust as the base language, by which
            I was able to create a safe, highly performant API with webassembly. To allow my code to be used by
            Javascript, I implemented a small wrapper class with methods designed to accept or return objects
            compatible with Javascript, and then using the fantastic <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen">
            wasm_bindgen</a> crate, I export this class as a Javascript class and link it directly into this webpage.
            <br/>
            Voila! <span class="cmd" onclick="submitCmd('conway about')">Game of Life in action</span>
